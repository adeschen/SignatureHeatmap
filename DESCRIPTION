Title: Heatmap using signature gene list and RNA-seq expression data
Description: This package enables transcriptomic classification of 
    samples by generating a heatmap for a specific signature gene list. 
    There is currently three different 
    lists of genes available in the package: the original basal-like/classical 
    gene list for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from Moffitt et 
    al. 2015; the updated basal-like/classical list from 
    Miyabayashi et al. 2020 and the basal-like/classical list from 
    Tiriac et al. 2018 that has been developed for pancreatic ductal 
    adenocarcinoma (PDAC) organoids.
